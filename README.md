# python-challenge
Module 3 challenge from the Columbia Data Analytics Bootcamp
For this challenge, I needed to write 2 scripts, for analyzing financial data of a company and another for analyzing local voting data. 
I am not sure if this data is fictional or not. 
For the financial data, I needed to calculate total number of months covered by the data, the net total increase/decrease in profit,the average change in profit, the greatest increase in profit and the month at which it occured, and the greatest decrease in profit and the month at which it occured. The original data consisted of monthly records of increases/decreases in profit from a csv file. 
For the local voting data, I needed to find the total number of votes, and I need to tally up the votes for each candidate. In addition, I also needed to determine the winner. The original data consisted of all the voting records, with each record consisting of voter id, county, and the candidate.
